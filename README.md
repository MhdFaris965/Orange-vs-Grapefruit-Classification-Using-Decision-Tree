# Orange-vs-Grapefruit-Classification-Using-Decision-Tree
This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to distinguish between oranges and grapefruits based on features like acidity, sugar level, and color intensity. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn. A simple yet interpretable classification model built with Python.

# üçäüçá Orange vs Grapefruit Classification Using Decision Tree

**Project Type:** Machine Learning | Supervised Classification  
**Dataset:** Fruit Quality Parameters Dataset

## üéØ Objective

This project aims to build a **Decision Tree Classifier** that can accurately distinguish between oranges and grapefruits using measurable features such as acidity, sugar content, and fruit diameter.

Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of:

- Decision Tree Algorithm (ID3 / Gini Index)
- Feature Selection & Visualization
- Interpretable Tree-Based Modeling
